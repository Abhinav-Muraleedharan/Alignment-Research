Alignment Research:


General Directions:

1. Implement:-
    1.1 Zero Layer Transformers
    2.1 One  Layer Transformers [Attention Only]
    2.3 Two  Layer Transformers [Attention Only]

What is the goal of experiment ? 

First of all, I would like to understand the architecture in detail. I have a good sense of things - but my understanding isn't complete.
Second, I need to understand how the directions in the activation space relate to different emergent qualities of the model. 
Third, I would like to test unitary rotation layer hypothesis.
